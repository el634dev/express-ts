# Typescript & Express
> Create a repo showcasing my code where I learned how to use Typescript with Express

# Acknowledgement
> The code is from this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgnJNJk9-to)

# Getting Started
> After you have cloned or forked this repo, run `npm install`

> If you have forked this repo, it may make a pull request to this repo instead of your repo. To fix change the remote origin URL and delete the old URL first, if this does not work then try deleting the fork and create a new repo.
